# Numerical Techniques for ODEs in Python

This repository provides Python code for various numerical techniques to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The implemented methods include the Euler method, Symplectic Euler method, Runge-Kutta method of the second order (RK2), Bulirsch-Stoer method, Predictor-corrector methods, and leveraging the `scipy` library for ODEs.


## Overview

ODEs are fundamental in modeling dynamic systems, and various numerical techniques are employed to approximate their solutions. This repository provides a collection of Python scripts showcasing different methods to solve ODEs, offering flexibility and understanding of each technique's strengths and limitations.

## Importance of ODEs

Ordinary Differential Equations are crucial in modeling real-world phenomena involving rates of change. They find applications in various scientific and engineering disciplines, such as:

1. **Physics:** Describing the motion of particles, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics.
2. **Biology:** Modeling population dynamics, enzyme kinetics, and physiological processes.
3. **Engineering:** Analyzing control systems, circuit dynamics, and structural vibrations.
4. **Economics:** Understanding economic growth, investment, and resource allocation.
5. **Computer Science:** Simulating algorithms, network traffic, and computer graphics.

ODEs provide a mathematical framework to describe how quantities change with respect to time. Solving ODEs numerically allows us to simulate and analyze complex systems that may not have analytical solutions.
